1. Average OI is Misleading
Scanner shows aggregate OI across all strikes
Specific strikes may have zero liquidity
Always verify before trading
2. Back Month is the Bottleneck
Front month usually liquid (high volume)
Back month often has poor liquidity
Check back month FIRST
3. Academic Research Validates Strategy
Forward variance is biased predictor (proven)
Long-short portfolios are profitable (proven)
Inverted structures can be genuine opportunities (proven)
4. Execution > Theory
Great opportunity on paper ≠ tradeable
Slippage can eat 15-20% of position
Position sizing must respect liquidity
5. Mid-Caps Retain Retail Edge
Less institutional attention
Higher volatility = larger FF opportunities
Sweet spot: $5B-$50B market cap
