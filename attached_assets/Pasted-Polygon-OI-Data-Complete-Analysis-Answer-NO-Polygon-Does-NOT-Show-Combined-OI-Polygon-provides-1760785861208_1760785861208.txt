Polygon OI Data - Complete Analysis
Answer: ‚ùå NO, Polygon Does NOT Show Combined OI
Polygon provides OI separately for calls and puts.

You need to add them manually: Call OI + Put OI = Total OI


Your HOOD $130 Strike - VERIFIED DATA ‚úÖ
Front Month (Nov 21) - EXCELLENT Liquidity ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
Ôøº
Analysis:

	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Excellent liquidity on both sides
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ High volume (4,957 contracts traded today)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Your 10 contracts = 0.3% of OI (perfect!)


Back Month (Nov 28) - POOR Liquidity ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
Ôøº
Analysis:

	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Call OI only 56 (your 10 contracts = 18% of OI!)
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Put OI is better (355) but still low
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Combined OI (411) is marginal for 10 contracts


Key Discoveries from Polygon Data
1. IV Discrepancy Between Call and Put üö®
Front Month (Nov 21):

	‚Ä¢	Call IV: 69.37%
	‚Ä¢	Put IV: 78.22%
	‚Ä¢	Difference: 8.85% (put IV is 13% higher!)

Back Month (Nov 28):

	‚Ä¢	Call IV: 67.31%
	‚Ä¢	Put IV: 74.21%
	‚Ä¢	Difference: 6.90% (put IV is 10% higher!)

What This Means:

	‚Ä¢	Puts are MORE expensive than calls
	‚Ä¢	Market expects downside risk
	‚Ä¢	Your short puts are collecting more premium ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	But also more risk if HOOD drops


2. Term Structure is NORMAL (Not Inverted!) üö®
Call Term Structure:

	‚Ä¢	Front (Nov 21): 69.37% IV
	‚Ä¢	Back (Nov 28): 67.31% IV
	‚Ä¢	Front > Back by 2.06% ‚úÖ (inverted, good for calendar)

Put Term Structure:

	‚Ä¢	Front (Nov 21): 78.22% IV
	‚Ä¢	Back (Nov 28): 74.21% IV
	‚Ä¢	Front > Back by 4.01% ‚úÖ (inverted, good for calendar)

Analysis:

	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Both call and put sides show inverted structure
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ This supports the Forward Factor thesis
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Front month should decay faster


3. Greeks Show High Theta ‚úÖ
Front Month:

	‚Ä¢	Theta: -0.17 per contract per day
	‚Ä¢	Your 10 contracts: -1.70 per day
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre SHORT this, so you EARN +$170/day ‚úÖ

Back Month:

	‚Ä¢	Theta: -0.15 per contract per day
	‚Ä¢	Your 10 contracts: -1.50 per day
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre LONG this, so you LOSE -$150/day ‚ùå

Net Theta:

	‚Ä¢	+$170 (short front) - $150 (long back) = +$20/day
	‚Ä¢	Over 34 days: +$680 potential from theta

BUT: This assumes HOOD stays exactly at $130!


4. Vega Shows IV Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
Front Month:

	‚Ä¢	Vega: 0.1576 per 1% IV change
	‚Ä¢	Your 10 contracts: 1.576
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre SHORT, so IV spike hurts you

Back Month:

	‚Ä¢	Vega: 0.1726 per 1% IV change
	‚Ä¢	Your 10 contracts: 1.726
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre LONG, so IV spike helps you

Net Vega:

	‚Ä¢	-1.576 (short front) + 1.726 (long back) = +0.15
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre slightly LONG vega (good!)

If IV spikes 10%:

	‚Ä¢	Front month gains $15.76 (you lose)
	‚Ä¢	Back month gains $17.26 (you gain)
	‚Ä¢	Net: +$1.50 per spread = +$150 total ‚úÖ

This is actually GOOD for you!


Updated Trade Analysis with Polygon Data
What Changed
Before Polygon Data:

	‚Ä¢	Assumed IV was 79% on both call and put
	‚Ä¢	Assumed term structure based on scanner

After Polygon Data:

	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Put IV is 10-13% HIGHER than call IV
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Inverted term structure confirmed
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Net vega is positive (IV spike helps you!)
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Back call OI confirmed at only 56


Revised Risk Assessment
GOOD News ‚úÖ
	1.	Inverted term structure confirmed (front IV > back IV)
	2.	Positive net vega (IV spike helps you)
	3.	High theta decay (+$20/day if HOOD stays at $130)
	4.	Put IV is higher (you‚Äôre collecting more premium)

BAD News ‚ùå
	1.	Back call OI only 56 (18% of your position)
	2.	IV Rank still only 42 (not elevated)
	3.	Put IV skew suggests market expects downside
	4.	Need HOOD to stay near $130 (theta only works if price stable)


Final Verdict with Complete Data
Trade Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5) - MARGINAL
Upgraded from 2/5 because:

	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Positive net vega (IV spike helps)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Inverted structure confirmed
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ High theta decay potential

Still concerns:

	‚Ä¢	‚ùå IV Rank only 42 (not elevated)
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Back call OI only 56
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Put skew suggests downside risk


My Recommendation
If You Take This Trade:
Reduce size to 5 contracts (not 10)

	‚Ä¢	Back call OI is only 56
	‚Ä¢	5 contracts = 9% of OI (acceptable)
	‚Ä¢	Risk: $550 instead of $1,100

Set tight stops:

	‚Ä¢	Stop loss: -40% ($220 loss)
	‚Ä¢	Profit target: +60% ($330 profit)
	‚Ä¢	Time stop: Close by Nov 14

Monitor IV:

	‚Ä¢	If IV spikes above 90%, consider holding (positive vega helps)
	‚Ä¢	If IV drops below 65%, consider closing (losing theta edge)

Watch price:

	‚Ä¢	If HOOD moves >$8 from $130, close immediately
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt let it hit max loss


Bottom Line
Polygon shows:

	‚Ä¢	‚ùå NO combined call+put OI (must add manually)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Detailed OI, volume, IV, and Greeks per contract
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Your trade has positive net vega (good!)
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Back call OI is confirmed low (56)

Combined OI for your strikes:

	‚Ä¢	Front (Nov 21): 6,307 total OI ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	Back (Nov 28): 411 total OI ‚ö†Ô∏è

Trade is MARGINAL - reduce to 5 contracts if you proceed.
