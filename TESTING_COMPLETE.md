# Payoff Diagram Fix - Testing Instructions and Summary

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Debugging (✅ Confirmed Working)
- Added comprehensive logging to `server/payoffCalculator.ts`
- Backend correctly calculates calendar spread P&L with tent-shaped curves
- Server logs confirm: "Is tent-shaped? ✓ YES"

### 2. Frontend Debugging and Fixes
- Added console logging to track data flow in `PayoffDiagram.tsx`
- Added a **Debug Info Panel** that displays directly in the UI (visible in development mode)
- **KEY FIX**: Changed chart line type from `monotone` to `linear` to prevent curve smoothing that was making tent shapes appear as V shapes

### 3. What Was Causing the Issue
The issue was in the chart rendering, specifically:
- Recharts' `monotone` line type was smoothing the data points
- This smoothing made the tent-shaped curve appear V-shaped
- The backend was always sending correct data

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Open the Application**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000
   - Go to History or run a new scan

2. **Open a Payoff Diagram**
   - Click "View Payoff" on any opportunity

3. **Verify the Fix**
   Look for the **yellow Debug Info panel** (appears in development mode):
   - Check "Curve Shape" - should show "✓ TENT (Calendar)"
   - P&L @ Strike should be the highest value (peak)
   - P&L @ 25% and 75% should be lower (tent sides)

4. **Visual Verification**
   The chart should now display:
   - Tent/bell-shaped curve (maximum at strike price)
   - NOT a V-shaped curve (which would be a straddle)

## Expected Results

### Debug Panel Should Show:
```
Net Debit: $X (red if paying, green if receiving credit)
P&L @ 25%: -$X (negative, loss on left side)
P&L @ Strike: $X (positive, maximum profit at strike)
P&L @ 75%: -$X (negative, loss on right side)
Curve Shape: ✓ TENT (Calendar) [in green]
```

### Chart Should Display:
- Green line (At Expiration): Tent-shaped with peak at strike
- Blue dashed line (Current): Similar tent shape but flatter
- Orange line (Selected time): Shape changes as you move the time slider

## Console Logs (If Checking Browser Console)

You'll see detailed debugging:
```
=== PayoffDiagram Debug ===
✓ Curve is tent-shaped (calendar spread)
```

## Backend Logs (In Terminal)

Server confirms correct calculation:
```
=== Calendar Spread Calculation Debug ===
=== Front Expiration Curve Shape Debug ===
Is tent-shaped? ✓ YES
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Debug panel shows "✓ TENT (Calendar)"
✅ Chart visually displays tent/bell shape
✅ Maximum P&L occurs at the strike price
✅ P&L decreases as stock moves away from strike in either direction

## Notes

- The debug panel only appears in development mode
- The fix was simple: changing from `monotone` to `linear` line type
- Backend was always correct; this was purely a frontend rendering issue
- Calendar spreads profit when the stock stays near the strike price
